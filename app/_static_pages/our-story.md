Colette and Mark met on Pi Day (March 14 or 3.14) in 2013. Their first and second dates were at one of their favorite watering holes, Hamilton’s Tavern in the South Park neighborhood. Their third date was at Mark’s house, where he intended to woo Colette with his romantic cooking skills.

Mark definitely impressed her… with his notorious lateness, even at his own house. Luckily, Colette thought he was worth the wait, and the rest is magical history.

Mark discovered the most beautiful, compassionate, and caring person ever. Her ability to open her heart and express herself at all times was more than inspiring. She truly brought out the best in him and allowed him to be himself.

Colette fell for Mark’s huge heart, outgoing personality, and his amazing cooking and car­washing skills. It also helped that he was handsome… and living somewhere with a pool and hot tub. He loved her like she’d never been loved before.
