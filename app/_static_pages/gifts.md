Hello, family and friends!

First and foremost, we want to express how grateful we are for your love and support in our lives. We understand the effort involved in traveling to a wedding, and celebrating our wedding with you fills our hearts with even more gratitude!

We are fortunate enough to have a house full of all the things we needâ€”dishes and breadmaker and blender aplenty! So, instead of a traditional registry, we have chosen to create [a honeymoon registry](https://www.honeyfund.com/wedding/therewillbepie2016) to help us go on the honeymoon of our dreams in New Zealand. We both love to travel and are so excited for our first trip as husband and wife. We know it will create memories to last a lifetime!

Love,

Colette & Mark
