Ceremony starts at 4:15 PM

[Pine Hills Lodge](http://www.pinehillslodge.com/)  
2960 La Posada Way  
Julian, CA 92036

Reception to follow.

A few notes on attire. Mostly, we want you to be comfortable and ready to have fun for the evening. The wedding party will be dressed to the nines, so if we have to choose an official label for the dress code, let's say somewhere in the range of semiformal to casual. Weather permitting, the ceremony will take place outside in the grass. At this point, your guess as to the weather forecast is as good as ours--but our guess is somewhere between warm and comfortable during the ceremony and cool at night.
