![David][00]
: ### David
  Mark and David met nine months before birth and have remained nearly as close ever since. Having a live­in best friend was great for double the presents, video game competitions, a vacation buddy, someone who actually understood just how unreasonable your parents could be and best yet, being “banished to your room” meant sleep over party!

![Matt][01]
: ### Matt
  Friends since before they could talk… and considering they continue to text regularly, this tradition continues to this day. Always a part of some crazy scheme, Matt was the only one brazen enough to go through with it and usually the one who got caught and took the fall. From getting stuck waste deep in mud at “the pond” to the annual 4th of July Rag of Fire game, they forged a lifelong bond.

![Jason][02]
: ### Jason
  Also friends since before they could talk… and when they could talk, it was usually about Legos, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or candy at “the little store”. They definitely tied having the sweetest car senior year each driving a ’67 Mustang. Despite being separated by the Pacific Ocean, they still cheer or console each other for every Seahawks game. Go Hawks!

![Shannon][03]
: ### Shannon
  Shannon and Colette met while coaching high school swimming in San Diego in 2006. Colette refused to be Shannon’s friend at first, as Shannon was closer in age to the swimmers than to Colette. Thankfully, Shannon didn’t give up on Colette, and eventually a friendship was forged. Even though Shannon lives in San Francisco now, the two talk and text all the time (more than they text their significant others) and recently even went on a three week adventure together in Panama.

![Katie ][04]
: ### Katie
  Katie and Colette first became friends sophomore year of high school when Brother Benedict gave them a pack of signed hall passes to use at their discretion during homeroom. After countless hours of high school adventures together, they moved away from home, but they have always managed to stay close and visit each others new hometowns. During the summer of 2016, Colette interned in Boulder and was lucky enough to be roommates with Katie and her husband, where they spent many hours grilling in the backyard, chatting on the patio, hiding from a bat in Katie’s house, camping and hiking in Utah—all definite highlights of Colette’s Colorado adventure.

![Moira][05]
: ### Moira
  Moira and Colette met on the swim team in college. One time during Colette’s freshman year, Moira showed up at Colette’s door, out of breath from sprinting across campus, just to tell her about an upcoming concert. That was the start of a friendship that was cemented over the next four years of swimming, math majoring, concert­going, lifeguarding, and being roommates. To this day, Colette credits Moira with teaching her how to love beer, and for that, she is forever grateful.
