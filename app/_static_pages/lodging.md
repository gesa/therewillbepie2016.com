We are excited to get married in Julian and hope you’ll enjoy San Diego’s quaint “mountain” town. This small town is located about 60 miles outside of San Diego (an hour+ drive) at an elevation of 4000 feet. Julian comes with plenty of charm but somewhat limited accommodations. We have a few recommendations and tips for you to ensure everyone has lodging for our big night. We encourage you to book your rooms ASAP—Julian is so great in October that it is considered their high season. (Don’t forget to ask for senior or AAA discounts when booking your hotel stays.)

### Julian

If you are staying Friday and Saturday nights in Julian, we encourage you to check out the following hotels, which have two-night minimum stays:

- [Julian Gold Rush Hotel Bed and Breakfast](http://www.julianhotel.com/)
- [Orchard Hill Country Inn](http://www.orchardhill.com/)

If you are only staying in Julian on Saturday night, the main option is [Julian Lodge](http://www.julianlodge.com/). There is a small block of rooms reserved for the Smirniotis/Olsen wedding here, which will be released to the public August 1 if not booked by our party.

- For bed & breakfasts and more, check out the “Lodging” tab at <http://www.julianca.com/>
- For some alternative lodging options, check out <https://www.vrbo.com/> and <https://www.airbnb.com/>
- For our outdoorsy friends, there is camping available nearby, including [William Heise County Park](http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/parks/Camping/heise.html).

### San Diego

If you are staying in San Diego proper, there are hotels galore! For your convenience, there is a block of rooms available for reservation Thursday and Friday nights at the [Best Western Seven Seas](https://bw7seas.com/) in Mission Valley/Hotel Circle. Hotel Circle area is popular because of its abundance of hotels in a location near the airport, stores, restaurants, and attractions—plus it’s close to our neighborhood.

If that doesn’t sound right for you, here are some other areas to consider:

- **Downtown San Diego/Gaslamp:** nice hotels and restaurants; a bit fancier (and pricier)
- **Ocean Beach:** Colette loves OB for its relaxed vibe and delicious tacos, but be warned it’s full of hippies
- **Mission Beach**: quintessential boardwalk experience in San Diego; casual dining, tourist/souvenir shops, and a variety of hotel options
- **La Jolla**: beautiful shoreline complete with cliffs and seals; fine dining, luxury hotels, and a Ferrari-Maserati dealership (if you need a last minute wedding gift)
